<h3>COMP10002 Assignment 1 Feedback: teej1</h3>

<p>
<h4>Program Presentation</h4>

Including: layout and style, readability, adherence to coding
expectations, general care and appearance.

</ul><p>
<i>Deductions</i>
<p>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
<b>Deduct 0.5 marks for every type of error found.</b>
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>bad choices for variable names; - avoid single letter var names other than i, j, k for iteration. Remember if you have a couple of loops they can be reused.
<li>other stylistic issue (minor); - avoid mixing naming styles, such as camel case with snake case (i.e. someFunc vs some_func)

<i>Additions (included in total mark only
if marks lost within this first section)</i>

<li>comment that says "algorithms are fun", +0.5;

<h4>Structure and Approach</h4>

Including: decomposition in to functions, development of data
structures and declaration of them at the appropriate locations,
choice of parameters to functions, use of appropriate <tt>struct</tt>
and
<tt>typedef</tt> declarations, choice of algorithms or methods.

<i>Deductions</i>
<br>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
<b>Deduct 0.5 marks for every type of error found.</b>
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>duplicate code segments (overlaps between Stages 4 and 5 are allowed); - for example, lots of repeated swapping code in stage 5 - great candidate for a function!
<li>insufficient use of functions; - stage 4 and stage 5 functions are both huge - try to break long slabs of code like this out into functions as much as possible

</ul><p>

<h4>Program Execution</h4>
Including: compilation, execution on test data, output presentation
and readability.<br>
Programs that do not compile in the test environment will lose all
marks in this section.
Be sure to <tt>verify</tt> your submission and <b>check the output</b>
before you say "finished" to yourself.
<p>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
<p><ul>

<li>Up to Stage 1 initial allocation, +2.
<li>Up to Stage 2 initial allocation, +5.
<li>Up to Stage 3 initial allocation, +6.
<li>Up to Stage 4 initial allocation, +9.
<li>Up to Stage 5 initial allocation, +9.
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul><p>
<i>Deductions</i>
<p>Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>add back 1 mark for correct output in stage 5 of all tests,
0.5 marks for mostly correct output in stage 5 of all tests; the total mark should not exceed 15. (+1 mark)

<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->
</ul><p>
<p>
<h4>Late Penalty</h4>
If you make a late submission without having prior agreement from
the lecturer, late penalties will apply at the rate of 2 marks per day or part day late.
Submissions late for more than two days won't be accepted. Overall marks won't go below zero.

<h4>14.5/15</h4> <!-- will be replaced automatically -->


<i>Overall comments from marker</i>:<p>

Outputs were perfect! :) However there are some style/structure issues that would be good to address. Most importantly, more functions! But great job overall.
