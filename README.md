# COMP10002-SkylinePoints 2017 Semester 1

Using C to implement a skyline operator, we were given a skeleton code file for this assignment in LMS. 
The skeleton code file contains a main function that has been completed already. 

## Result

14.5/15 :thumbsup:

Overall comments from marker:
 > Outputs were perfect! :) However there are some style/structure issues that would be good to address. Most importantly, more functions! But great job overall.
